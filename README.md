# TempoPert: Deep learning of temporal gene expression trajectories enables time-resolved drug response prediction and repositioning

This repository hosts the official implementation of TempoPert, a deep learning framework designed to model the temporal evolution dynamics of drug perturbations. By simulating the progression from basal state through early and late response phases, TempoPert captures the temporal trajectories of drug effects that static models miss.
